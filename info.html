      <h2>Thesis</h2>
      <p>
        This thesis explores how two-dimensional visual constructs can act as sensory translators that
        shift and skew spatial perception. It asks how public and semi-public environments might be
        reimagined through layered, material-driven interventions that rethink how space is seen, touched,
        and understood. The project uses a neutral warehouse as its container, not as an architectural
        type to be celebrated, but as a blank shell to be reoccupied with conflicting sensory logics.
      </p>

    <section class="card reveal">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        The design process begins with the author’s personal perception of space as someone with
        synesthesia, an experience where senses overlap and blend. Early work involved creating
        dissolving, layered collages to externalize this perceptual multiplicity. These collages were
        then digitally transformed using Midjourney AI—not to produce architectural renderings, but to
        investigate how different material atmospheres could alter the same structural container. Through
        iterative blending, each image proposed a distinct material effect (porous, reflective, fuzzy,
        translucent) with its own sensory implications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card reveal">
      <h2>Translation</h2>
      <p>
        From these blended images, the project isolates and translates specific material effects into
        vignettes. Each vignette is a prototype that tests the tension between what is seen and what is
        felt, between surface and depth, between clarity and confusion. The work draws from Mies van der
        Rohe’s collage techniques, using them not to assert perspectival control but to introduce friction
        and misalignment. It also references immersive art and architecture practices—Olafur Eliasson,
        James Turrell, Yayoi Kusama, and Philip Beesley—engaging the body through atmosphere, light,
        repetition, and interaction.

      <h2>Proposal</h2>
      <p>
        The final model reoccupies the warehouse shell with overlapping, conflicting material systems.
        Rather than a single, unified reading, it proposes architecture as a layered, unstable field—one
        that resists resolution and invites multiple modes of sensing. <em>The Felt Image</em> asks how
        architecture can be designed not only to be seen, but to be felt.
