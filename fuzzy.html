    <div class="bubble bubble1">
      The environment is sculpted from synthetic fiber masses resembling piled insulation, teased wool, or extruded foam. These materials feel fabricated yet soft, bridging industrial construction with bodily softness. <br><br>
      <em>The material speaks of excess, blur, and buildup. A counter to clean rational lines.</em>
    </div>
    <div class="bubble bubble2">
      The surfaces range from flossy to dense almost like dryer lint, cotton candy, or matte fleece. Their texture is non-reflective absorbing light rather than bouncing it. <br><br>
      <em>Texture here is ambiguous. It looks soft but massive, inviting but unreadable like touching something through memory.</em>
    </div>
    <div class="bubble bubble3">
      The lighting is hazy and emotional with subtle pinks, lavenders, aquas, and warm white tones bleeding into each other. <br><br>
      <em>The ambiance doesn’t direct. It envelops. There’s no clarity here. Only immersion.</em>
