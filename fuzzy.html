        The environment is sculpted from synthetic fiber masses resembling piled insulation, teased wool, or extruded foam. These materials feel fabricated yet soft, bridging industrial construction with bodily softness. They cling to the architecture not as finishings but as fuzzy intrusions occupying space like a cloud or fungus colonizing a rigid frame. <br><br><em>The material speaks of excess, blur, and buildup. A counter to clean rational lines.</em>

      <div class="term">Texture</div>
      <div class="full-text">
        The surfaces range from flossy to dense almost like dryer lint, cotton candy, or matte fleece. Their texture is non-reflective absorbing light rather than bouncing it creating an almost velvety field of spatial quietness. <br><br><em>Texture here is ambiguous. It looks soft but massive, inviting but unreadable like touching something through memory.</em>

      <div class="term">Ambience</div>
      <div class="full-text">
        The lighting is hazy and emotional with subtle pinks, lavenders, aquas, and warm white tones bleeding into each other. <br><br><em>The ambiance doesn’t direct. It envelops. There’s no clarity here. Only immersion.</em>
